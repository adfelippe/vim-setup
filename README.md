# vim-setup
## Smal script to easily setup vim

You must be connected to the internet in order to download and install a couple of packages. 

### INSTRUCTIONS
- Install vim first (duh!)
- Fetch yourself a cup of coffee
- Run `setup-vim.sh`

## The script will:
- Download and copy pathogen to the correct folder. See more at: [https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
- Copy my own .vimrc to your home folder
- Copy the bundles which will be run by pathogen
- Copy my color themes (monokai is set by default)
- Try to install cscope and ctags on a Debian-based distro
